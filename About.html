    <p id="aboutDescription"> <img id="sheffHallam" src="Images for HTML/Sheff hallam logo.jpg" alt="Code"> multi-skilled, talented Software Engineer currently studying at Sheffield Hallam University, 
        first year. I am looking for opportunities that will open the door to a lifetime career path 
        and provide me with the opportunities needed to excel in the sector of App Development. As I 
        am currently expanding my knowledge of languages such as C#, C++, and SQL, I am hoping to apply 
        this practically into the workplace. I have great interpersonal skills and an astounding work 
        ethic, with a drive to complete tasks to a perfect finish. <u>Photo courtesy of Sheffield Hallam Website shu.ac.uk</u></p>

        

        
        <p id="aboutDescription"> <img id="cSharpPic" src="Images for HTML/cSharpLogo.png" alt="C Sharp Logo"> For one of my assignments using C#, I've been working on recently are a fully functioning 
            game of Monopoly, with all the features of the actual game, with a few adjustments. This game allows up to 4 people
            to play at once with the classic player pieces. This game is programmed within Visual Studio 2017, using the Windows
            Forms App with .NET Framework. C# is a personal favorite of mine as I found the commands and syntax very easy to grasp,
            sparking me to work on little projects at home as well as building on my knowledge through online tutorials and programming 
            extra curriculum classes. Photo courtesy of <u>https://www.onlinebooksreview.com/articles/best-c-sharp-programming-books</u>

            For my C++ assignments, I have been planning, writing and executing a multitude of programs ranging from Console Menu's,
            to programs which perform Mathematical tasks such as listing a given position in the Fibonacci Sequence, to programs which 
            find out what day of the week a certain Date would fall under. I am incredibly interested in learning more C++ as I believe 
            there is so much to be done within the language and the opportunities for C++ Programmers are incredibly vast. For more 
            information about these programs or to see them in action, please click the 'Code' tab on the Navigation Bar. Photo courtesy of

        <p id="aboutDescription"> <img id="picMe" src="Images for HTML/meBetter.PNG" alt="Self Photo">
             When I am not focusing on my studies, I am usually out with friends either skating or generally socializing, because I 
             believe this is a great way to build character while still having a good time. I also enjoy playing either new or nostalgic
             video games to either see the stunning technological advances the industry has made or re-living childhood memories. Aside 
             from this, I enjoy exploring the newest Mobile Applications as I am hoping to follow the development career path of such 
             apps as I believe mobile apps are the future of technology. I particularly enjoy small indie games because I find it 
             interesting to see what can be done with such a small team and a passion for the industry. I also have an aquarium which me 
             and my friend have been working on. It is very rewarding to finally be done with purchasing and arranging the tank in the best
             way for the fish.
